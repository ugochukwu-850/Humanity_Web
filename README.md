# Humanity Web
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description: 
The humanity Web is simply a site that could collect verified or unverified information about history 
I would have called it a database of the unknown history that only few humans still remember 

You see as time goes on humans begin to forget about the past all the because of the enthausiasm about what the future holds, though it does not seem much harm at first but we must remember from where we came
This project spills my desire to create an open site where users can communicate about history of the past and plans for the future.
Though this project is nothing close to what it looks like in my mind It gives us a glimpse of what it would be iin the nearest future as I grow my skills to put something more usefull to the public 

### About The Humanity Web ### 
*** The humanity web *** is a site born in heart of an aspiring problem solver and ML engineer
The sites first designed is featured from the simple design of the Twitter coporations site 
This projects first working beta edition was first created and tested on the 25th of December 2022 after a One and half month of serious work by one of its enginners. Although this site doe not seem the fanciest but I beleive in the future it would do more __Good than harm to the existence of humans__ 

# Description #
The site comprises of some features I would consider as impressive considering the lack of experience and skill of its enginners
*** There are many features which are still in design , I would leave those and talk about the fully implemented functions of the site ***
- __Posts__
- __Commenting__ 
- __Registeration__ 
- __Login__
- __Logout__ 

# Posts #
On registeration and login you would be redirected to what I can call the Homepage or the index page 
On this page you would now see a at the top-most part a form allowing you to post you best moontime stories 
Rather than stopping at an only text post method you are also allowed to add images to your posts
__ You do this by clicking the __choose file__ button and selecting a file after which you would want to backup your posts 
In the nearest future post attachements like pdf file and videos and multiple image format would be allowed 
## Now you know how to make posts ! ##
To veiw you posts your might want to scroll down and you can read all the wonderfulor spooky tales people are willing to share 

Now you might be thinking but how do I express my feeling openly on a posts 

thats were __Comments__  come in 

# Comments #
I am suspecting you've seen a post you like !! ?How do I , how can I express my feelings  on the post 
Its preety simple!! You see that button  that says comment on the card or would I say below the post . click on It and you would be redirected to a page with posts and a rather old scholl form to express you thoughts 
Click the form and type in you thoughts then press enter or submit 
*** Congratulations you have just made your first post 
And incase you are the first person to comment on a post you would likely see a warming message telling you that your the first to comment 
It's ok don't get too emotional we got our users in mind 
Thank you that would be all for comments 

# Profile #
Yes !! I knew you were waiting for this as a matter of fact the profile page is one of the only implemented page on the control bar 
## Contro Bar ##
It is located on the left side of the three page website or would I say the first pane of the three pane website 
This bar is made up of links to each and every functions the Humanity Web offers you .. 

Although this page has a lot of links or buttons am sorry to tell you but as at the time of writting this docs only 3 of them have been implemented and ready to use 

# Register #
When you visit any website atleast for those that hold nearly credible information you would get to find out that they want to get little details of the contributor ..  This is actually the case here 
Since the humanity Web is a website that stores data for future use you might want to be sure our users are credible some basic information about them

__That is were the register page comes in __
 This page is a one static page that contains forms for the user to fill inorder to register 
 You might want to leave out some of the forms but sorry am not sure that would go down  well
 It would run into an apology page for which is featured from cs50 apology page 

 When you first get to this site You would see the login page but you don't even have an account 

 Look down there is a blue link with the word Register on aclick of that link you would be redirected to the register page 

 This page comprises of forms and about three buttons off which two are for picking you display picture and cover photo

 I would look into some of them for now 

 __username __ ::  This is name that would repesent you on every action you take on the site and cannot be shared between two individuals 
 Infact trying to pick a username that is not unique would end up getting you to the apology page 

 ON filling of these forms and selecting a display picture and cover photo

 click on the submit button and 
 ### Congratulations You have just created an account to contribute to the history of humanity ###

 # Login # 
 The login system is symple if you already have an account 

 Just input your username and password and watch the magic 

 ***  The magic ***:: the backend takes your input and checks if you have an account 
 if yes you get to the homepage else you could be told create an account 

 Last but not the least 
 # Logout #
 The logout function takes you out of the time travel machine I meant the Humanity Web 
 On the control panel the last button with the value "logout" > on click takes you out of the museum and back to the museum gate 
 sorry I meant back to the login page 


### This Is A BETA edition ###

>I am grateful to the staffs of this prestigious firm Cs50 for taking me this far from being a dolard in the world of tech It was an experience 

### There are a lot of functions that have links and are implemented in css and Html but do not work!!! so enjoy posting and commenting the futre holds better but the past tell better  ###
